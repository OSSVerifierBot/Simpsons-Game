# Simpsons-Game


This is a project that was done in an intro to programming class.
The program creates a mini world and characters. The player moves
around randomly until he runs into a bully or a tailor. If he runs
into a tailor, he pays to get his pants fixed. If he runs into a bully, 
he loses money. The player will get chased by "zombie pants" and will
remain playing until his life and or money runs out.
